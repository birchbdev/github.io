      <p class="leading-relaxed">
        I'm Bryan, a software engineer with a background in ICU and interventional radiology nursing. My journey from bedside care to building clinical software and embedded systems was driven by a desire to make healthcare tools smarter, more efficient, and more human-centered.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">
        After earning my computer science degree, I began designing systems that bridge the physical and digital ‚Äî from microcontroller-based tools like RFID-enabled scuba gear trackers and ESP32 weather stations, to full-stack apps that streamline hospital procedure scheduling or provide real-time CPR feedback.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Whether I‚Äôm designing a cross-platform app with Vue and Capacitor, integrating embedded hardware, or applying AI to support staff workflows, my focus is always on clarity, usability, and impact.
